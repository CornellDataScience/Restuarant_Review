Here's my breakdown of each part.Ton Katsu (my choice) - Might as well be called a fried panko box cuz that was about all there was with literally (and I mean literally) 2-3mm thick pork cutlet. It was honestly impressive at how thin they were able to make this pork cutlet. Minimal meat flattened to maximize surface area to look like a lot of food. Probably spent about 5 minutes taking off one side of panko on each piece and then putting two pieces together....Other items that come with the bento box:Tempura - not bad actually. batter is decent. BUT they only give you vegetables and kani stick (no shrimp tempura, like plum tree in collegetown)Dumplings - gyoza and shumai are both deep fried. like deep deep fried with extra oil as you bite into it. I was hoping the shumai would be steamed (again, like plum tree). it would help balance out the grease of the other foodFried scallop - not bad. but it's absolutely the kind you get frozen in the supermarket.Seaweed salad - about a tablespoon, with meh flavorGreen salad - decentCalifornia roll - ok i guess, but the rice is off. doesn't have the right consistency that sushi rice should have. Miso soup and rice - good, your standard miso soup and your standard ricetldr - it was ok. HEAVY on the grease.

I would have given it a minus 5 stars if I could. I like this place: the food is good and they serve fast. I have been recommending it to my friends. About half an hour ago, I went and tried to order the poke bowl. The lady serving me was blond, thin, and pale, in her early twenties or late teens. She was not happy but OK at the beginning, but when she was adding the sauce, I told her to add \"just a tini-tiny bit\". She kept pouring. I tried to stop three times by saying \"that's good... that's enough... that's already too much\", but she kept pouring and ignored me. It was because that was the last bit of sauce left in the bottle. She said to me \"there is not much more (in the bottle)\" and finished the bottle. Why does how much was left in the bottle has anything to do what should be in my bowl? The bowl soaked in sauce and I really do not want to buy it. I told her \"I really do not want that much sauce\". That is when she flipped and said \"Do you want to waste the entire bowl and make me do it all over again?\" When I was hesitating, she started complaining about me to her colleagues, a blond guy and an Asian/Hispanic looking women, both of whom offered to help her. She refused their help and yelled at me \"OK, you want to waste food. You are pissing me off!!\" I could not believe what I heard - no mature adult says that, let alone someone in the hospitality industry. She was very angry when she re-did my bowl. I am glad that I can watch her making the bowl. If I could not, I would be worried about my food safety as she seems like the kind of person that would spit or put weird things in people's food.After she put in about 5-10% of the sauce of what she put in the first time, she paused and looked at me in a wired way. Honestly, that was not enough sauce, but I just wanted to be done with her and said \"that is good\". She looked surprised that I wanted so little sauce but then decided to say \"that is literally the same\". I said \"that is not\". She flipped again and refused to finish the bowl and stepped away. I asked \"may I know your name?\" She said \"no\". Later she said \"if you want to tell the manager about this, I can tell him myself!\", yelling from the far end of the work station. When the other lady helped me finish the bowl and apologized for her colleague's terrible attitude. She was annoyed and yelled \"I am trying to serve fish (to the next customer).\" I tried to not take it personally because her attitude toward her colleagues and the next customer was equally bad, but I was only there to get lunch and should not be yelled at and intimated.

Rochester knows how to do subs and the people they trained in Ithaca are no different. There was a decent line on the Saturday afternoon that I was there (they opened officially on Thursday, so still in the early opening days), but the line moved super quickly and everyone knew exactly what was going on. When I ordered a sub by name, I didn't have to repeat what meat was in it, I only said what type of bread, cheese, etc. once. Definitely on top of their stuff.AND, unlike *my* DiBella's on East Ave, they have COKE ZERO! Talk about exciting.My only knock down from 5 stars was that the bread, while great, was not quite up to the quality I expect from DiBella's. I'm not sure if that's because they overbaked the amount they'd need in the morning, or what, but the bread was just a little tougher than I was used to. I go back and forth from dining in at DiBella's and having DiBella's 4-5 hours after my boyf picks it up for me. Unfortunately, both rolls were just a little tougher than we were used to.We got the DiBella's Philly and the Uncle Louie on plain and multigrain respectively, so we did try different types of bread and noticed it was the same with both.Even with that, I would not hesitate to go back with regularity.

It might have just been the fact that we were going delusional from all the studying, but my friend and I were very impressed with the pizza.

The lady I spoke to said she'd put it down as a reservation for me and that the tables would be ready at 7pm.I arrived there with my friends and speak to the host only to be faced with a shocked \"OH MY GOSH\" look because the other lady I spoke to the day before only wrote it down on a piece of paper without telling anyone or putting it into their system. My party was then told that it would take 15 minutes to assemble all the tables together. Not wanting to be too pushy, I waited 25 minutes with my party before I asked them how much longer it would take. \"Another 5 minutes, they're just cleaning the tables.\" Another 15 minutes pass and my party is starting to get hungry (so were already really hungry), and I check up with them again, feeling a bit angsty. Another hostess is there and starts reprimanding me for not knowing how their processes work by saying I couldn't reserve and that I had to call within an hour to do so, so it wasn't the restaurant's fault for not having it ready. Whoever I spoke to was wrong and I was wrong for whatever I had heard or done. Another 20 minutes pass until my party was FINALLY seated.

To preface, I recently moved to Ithaca one week ago. I was celebrating my birthday and I was experiencing my first Commons festival (The Chili Cookoff Festival). My friends and I had stopped by the Monk's booth to try their chili and they were giving away $15 certificates on their booth table to encourage chili participants to venture to their restaurant location afterwards. After indulging in all of the chili we wanted/needed, my friends and I headed to Monk's restaurant. We walked right in with no issues. We reviewed the certificate provided \"$15 towards featured Rioja Wine\" on the drink menu there were 3 options for Rioja wine - 2 blushes and 1 red. We laid out our certificates and asked the bartender, if she would please describe the different types of Rioja wines to us. My friend and I had the blush wine for a 9oz carafe for $11, her boyfriend had nothing. We drank our wine and when the bill came, we laid our certificates into the check presenter. The manager said, \"Oh, those are only for the red Rioja wines.\" My friends were disappointed and with an unexpected, \"oh....\" laid their cards into the bill presenter - to pay for my birthday beverage. I had asked if I could speak with the manager. I specifically asked him before he would run the cards if we could discuss the certificate situation. Without a blink of an eye, he ran the cards and said, \"Well, you should have asked your server which specific Rioja wine the certificate covered.\" I said, \"I'm sorry, but we had our certificates out and we were asking only about the Rioja wines, the certificate doesn't say specifically the red.\" His response, \"I wouldn't have bothered to tell you either, if you didn't criticize her wine descriptions.\" She was standing next to him at that moment. I apologized, \"I'm sorry that we criticized your wine descriptions.\" Her response was, \"You didn't. I don't know why he said that,\" and walked away. He laid the paid bill down and walked away. For a mission statement to state: Tradition of Integrity.Be Accurate, Honest, and Fair.Avoid Even the Appearance of Wrongdoing.Obey the Law.Understand the Implications of Your Actions.Be Trustworthy.Treat Others with Dignity and Respect.Work for the Good of the Community.None of these were portrayed and in fact left me and my friends insulted and disgusted.

The slices are piping hot and not at all like that thin pizza you get in the city, these slices are thick and chewy with an acidity/sweet/garlic-y sauce with mellow but flavorful melted cheese that tastes more like a blend of whole milk mozzarella, provolone, and perhaps a bit of munster or brick cheese for added richness. The black olives add just the perfect amount of salt and brine to round out these flavorful slices of pure pizza perfection. The pale ale is a perfect beer to accompany the grease from the cheese.

I have gone on several occasions, and every time I have been the pizza has had a lot of cheese on it. They border on a little too much cheese in my opinion, and hence why I only gave them 4 stars instead of 5. While their pizza was overly cheesy, it also had enough sauce to balance out that extra cheese. The sauce was zesty and tart, but still sweet enough to balance out the zesty tartness (if that even makes sense). Two weeks ago when I sat down for dinner with a group of friends for my birthday I asked if they could do a pineapple jalape\u00f1o pizza. The waitress said they didn't have jalape\u00f1os but recommended we try banana peppers instead. Oh my god, that topping combination was heaven. A few months before that I ordered a pizza with red peppers that were not very good, so I would say that this was a huge improvement.Perhaps my favorite item on the menu is their unusual chicken wings. The chicken wings are really crispy but not battered. In addition, the buffalo sauce is unique. It has a hint of some sort of holiday spice in it (maybe nutmeg or cinnamon) that really makes them unusual. Everyone at the table loved the wings, and wished we ordered more of them. They also have BBQ sauce wings and those were also quite tasty. One person at my birthday dinner ordered boneless wings but I didn't get a chance to try them, because the group scarfed them down too quickly.Northeast Pizza shares a space with Scale House Brew Pub, and hence you can order beer directly from the brewpub on tap. I don't usually drink beer so my taste in beer is not very refined, but I enjoyed all the home brewed flavors I have tried here. They brew several different kinds but only 3 - 4 of them are actually available at any given time.Everyday of the week they have a special of the day that rotates, and then repeats each week. Some days its a discounted extra large pizza. Other days its an order of wings with a medium one topping pizza combo deal. Either way the specials are the cheapest way to go.lastly, the atmosphere is quite fun. On the brewpub side the scale house has a few TVs that shows various sporting events and also have live music on select nights of the week. Often this music is quite folky. On the other side of the pizza parlor side they have a bowling game machine. The pizza parlor slash brewpub combo makes the place feel kind of like a PG version of a townie bar. I generally prefer to sit on the brewpub side because the appointments are nicer and it got us further from the door so cold air was not blowing on us.

One person in our party had a lemonade. $1.75 for the glass, but included refills. The rest of us prefer water. You should be able to find something that you find is OK to eat, and depending on your taste you may luck out and find something you think is good. In our party of three, we all found several things (most of which we've enjoyed numerous times at other restaurants) which we didn't care for at all. One person in our group said of the items he did finish that, \"they were just ok, not good\" (but, as he said, he could see going back if he were really hungry and didn't want to spend much.)There was a hibachi bar (pick out the food you wanted and they'd put it on the cooktop at the counter), but the items on it didn't look that intriguing to any of us so we passed on it. The sushi bar (pre-made rolls sitting there, without labels) didn't pique our interest, either. There was a carving station (carve your own) with ham, sausage and beef. The beef was well done (as in brown, all the way through) -- the one who ate it said it was chewy, but the flavor was good. There were a few soups to choose from. We didn't see any wonton soup. (Not a problem as we weren't in a soup mood. Just commenting as wonton soup is usually a staple at the buffets we'd been to in the past.)A couple of oddities on the buffet, which I haven't seen elsewhere:Crawfish and frogs legs. (Frogs legs were edible. I'm guessing that the crawfish were in some sort of Cajun seasoning which I didn't care for, but perhaps that's the type of seasoning rather than their preparation.)The dim sum that I ate was disappointing. And, as that's usually one area of the buffet where I usually have fun, it was a bit of a letdown that the selection was minimal. Dumplings and shu Mai were heavy and dried out. The egg roll that I had was awful. Took one bite and put it down (and was tempted to spit out what was in my mouth) -- thick, stale tasting crust.. I would have had to take another bite to get to any filling. I would have liked to see more vegetable dishes to choose from, to help balance out the various meat and seafood items. I did have some Bok Choy, which was as expected. I enjoyed the salt and pepper shrimp. Note: They were whole, with the heads on, which bothered the third person in our group. The person on our group who usually enjoys various items with barbecue sauce said those items were inedible here. The pork chops didn't look like they had a sauce, but they did and the sweet, heavy taste was overpowering. (Barbecue sauce, whether or not it was visible, tasted like a very heavy sugar glaze with no smokiness or anything to take away from the beyond-cloyingly sweetness.)Overall, if this were a restaurant where you ordered specific dishes, I would have only given it one or two stars.

Now granted it was 9:30 at night so my expectations were already low. But Denny's is known for serving breakfast 24 hours a day, so naturally I expected them to be able to meet my expectations I mean it's breakfast food!  Upon arrival we were greeted by our waiter, who then brought us to our table, while walking to our table I noticed how dirty the floor was and it seemed like it hadn't been properly mopped in about a month, because it had a greasy feel to it. At any rate our server was nice took our drink orders, and we decided to get a couple appetizers, being that my 3 children hadn't eaten since lunch time, it was a crazy day for them. We put in our order, pretty simple chicken tenders and nachos. When our apps finally came we got double of what we ordered and the nachos came about 5 mins after that, yikes. So now we order our food nothing fancy, no changes or special requests.  As we waited for our food, I began watch the workers as I can sometimes be a people watcher. Our table was located right by the dishwasher/ stockroom door. One thing that absolutely turned me off, was the workers who were not on the clock either their shift had ended or their shift was starting. Why did this bother me because they were sitting around in uniform at a table talking with the manager, it really made it look like they were being lazy. Not to mention the manager who is very nice, but she was so wrapped up in the conversation with employees who were not on the clock that she wasn't doing her job. I saw countless orders being left up on the shelf for a long time. So our food finally comes, but it would've sat there had it not been for a different server seeing it there, thankfully he was thoughtful enough to bring our food. We got SOME of our food, then our actual server came back, apologized to us because he had 1 other table in the front room, yeah like 1 table! My wife had ordered some sort of \"Slam\" she only received her eggs and sausage, we nicely and calmly told the waiter she needed the rest of her food, again it wasn't our real waiter! Meanwhile we have been there now for about 50 minutes and my wife still hadn't gotten all of her meal! By this time I'm getting more impatient by the second. My wife decided to go and talk to the manager who was still chatting with the off the clock employees at the same table, she had been there for all of a half hour! My wife calmly explained that there had been way too many mistakes and that we were far from satisfied. She gave my wife a few excuses as to why she was sitting down, and by the end of it gave us our meals for free. But her graciousness will NOT change my mind about this place! I get that the better breakfast cooks probably work the morning shift but in the end, shouldn't they be trying to serve quality food 24 hours a day?

There's just enough to complement the mozzarella underneath so they can mix the right way in your mouth with the green-flecked tomato sauce.

Now, you may think that I am contradicting myself, that I said the same thing about Sammy's. What I said about Sammy's is that they make the best New York style cheese pizza in Ithaca. However, the hands-down most delicious pizza made anywhere in this town comes from Souvlaki house. Their house special pizza is something spectacular. First off, the crust, always hand stretched from freshly made dough. This is the perfect foundation, as it always comes out perfectly crispy on the bottom, yet extremely moist and chewy on the inside. Even with a mountain of the greasiest toppings piled above, this crust always maintains its integrity. You could eat this pizza off your lap and have not a stain to speak for it. The sauce is decidedly mild, a plus in my book, as the sauce is not what I consider to be the centerpiece of the pizza. The cheese, likewise, is good, fresh mozzerella which serves as an excellent binder to tie everything together. What makes their pizza, however, are the toppings. The house special is topped with fresh sausage, pepperoni, bacon, green peppers, mushrooms and onions, all in extreme quantities. When you get this pizza you can see the care that goes into it, as all the toppings are perfectly distributed radially across all the slices. Each piece in its own is a work of art. Last time I went here, my friend and I ordered one of these; when the waitress brought it out, she put it down, stepped back and said \"wow, you guys have a great pizza here.\" That pretty much sums it up better than I ever could. Their other Greek selections are quite good as well, though the quality of the pizza makes limits my motivation to expand my horizons very much. I've had their eponymous souvlaki, and it is indeed name-worthy. The Greek salads, dolmas, spanakopita, baklava, and everything else that you would expect in a Greek restaurant are definitely up to par. Everything is made fresh in the open kitchen, right before your eyes.

MANDATORY15% TIP.As a senior Cornell student, I've been to Asian Noodle House multiple times during my time here. It's always been great until this time around. I went with a friend to have dinner there and the waiter was absolutely rude. At the end of our meal, my friend left a tip and the cashier came over saying that the tip was below 15% and told my friend that she HAD to give at least that much. She demanded a tip and then just walked away without any explanation whatsoever. After that brief and rude conversation, my friend decided that she didn't want to leave a bigger tip than she had already put on the receipt because of the rude cashier. Thus we decided to leave the restaurant when the waiter ran after us and told us that in America, there is a rule and that we must leave at least 15% tip. I told him that there is no such law and he replied back saying that it is a rule in American culture. When I asked him if he understood that tip was a rating of customer service, he refused to acknowledge my question and continued to tell me that I didn't understand American culture and as an international student, he understands it so well that he KNOWS that 15% tip is MANDATORY. He continued to ignore my questions and ended the conversation with \"I'm not here to argue, I'm just here to talk, we're never going to serve you again,\" and then turned around and left.

Not to mention the fact that they have azuki bean and green tea ice cream, in a bowl or waffle cone, at ridiculously cheap prices!The staff members are generally very warm and friendly. This is especially true for Fumi-san, who adores the way I dress :PSo why 5 stars? Cafe Pacific's menu is ever expanding and has a great selection of desserts ranging from molten chocolate cake to tiramisu. The entrees are probably the most authentically Japanese in Collegetown, Ithaca, compared to Plum Tree and Miyake's. There is also something quite unique about the atmosphere, too.

It started good, but throughout the months it's become terrible. (1) Inconsistent cooking. The steak here has become hilariously bad. Last time I ordered it, it was the most rubbery protein I've ever had. I'm not usually a picky eater, but I had to just stop eating because the steak was so springy. I chewed a piece over 30 times and still couldn't break it down. This happens bc they try to cook it too quickly without proper attention. Also when they cook the steak, they just cut the whole thing into pieces without discarding the gristle. So this last time, they gave me the last scoop of steak available (bc they are always running out of everything). Every third bite was just straight up gristle. Generally the cooking is just inconsistent. I usually get the greek-yogurt Caesar dressing, and I could tell one time that it wasn't made by accurately following the recipe. It was overpoweringly sour and had a much more dense texture that made it less like dressing and more thick like hummus. This kind of mistake happens quite often with several of the ingredients and it just shows that management doesn't care about quality control. (2) Inconsistent portions. I usually get a double portion of protein when I go here, but since they are always running out everything, they usually rip you off when you order double anything. Last time I ordered just a single portion of steak, they didn't even have enough but they just tried to slide it by me. They only put 5, very small slivers of steak on top of my salad and tried to pass it as sufficient. When I said something the manager came by and agreed with me and gave me more, but it's just not a good look when employees are too lazy to ensure you get the product you are paying for. (3) Ridiculous waiting time. I understand there isn't much you can do with waiting time when there's a huge crowd, but even when no one is there the workers work mind-numbingly slowly. It's not hard to put chopped meat and veggies in a bowl, but somehow they have found a way to mess this up. I love the idea of a health-centric fast food place like this in Ithaca. Unfortunately, it's pretty much the only option of it's kind in town which allows management to let this place slip into quality decay. When the quality of the food is at its best, this place is worth it. But in the last couple of months, they have almost purposefully deteriorated to the point where they cannot justify the high prices they charge.

There are plenty of pre-set options (too many, in my opinion - the menu is a little daunting especially for a first time visitor) and you can also choose to build your own.

I ordered one the Southwest grain bowl (Warm wild rice blend, antibiotic-free chicken, chopped romaine, avocado, jalapenos, tortilla strips, tomatoes, black beans, scallions, corn, shredded white cheddar) and got it with the suggested dressing, a lime cilanto jalapeno vinaigrette. They build the bowl in front of you in a Chipotle-style way.

I thought they weren't very generous at all with the chicken, but my main qualm was that the ingredients were just not that fresh. No, they weren't terrible, but there was such a stark difference between the quality here and the quality at Sweetgreen.

The counter service is mostly adequate, but sometimes indifferent or rude.The place is often overrun with college students, which accounts for some of the above problems.The food is standard Chipotle, but they often have OUTAGES, which brings me to my primary gripe:Dear Chipotle, if you are out of rice (both white & brown at the same time) and you put a sign on the door saying so, and there are 2 DIFFERENT SUPERMARKETS less than one-tenth of a mile away, not only do you look like idiots, but you are telling the public counter-productively that your customers don't matter, and that you don't mind putting your employees in uncomfortable and embarrassing positions.I say counter-productive, because I'm sure the supposed reason for not sending an employee real quick to go buy rice, is that you're protecting the standardization of your customers' experience.

The only thing is I only got away with not paying for double steak twice here but in NYC they forget to charge me extra more often. Sometimes I would cough or say something to distract the workers from passing along the message that I got double steak.The only issue with Chipotle is the oil they use; it is very high in omega 6 fatty acids.

It was only a matter of time before I tried to articulate what my taste buds do every time I visit. First and foremost, let me clairfy these 5 stars - Chipotle gets 5 stars for FAST MEXICAN food in Ithaca. It's local. I've eaten at the competitors, I've done my \"thing\", and Chipotle always leaves me happiest. So, \"you\": a health conscious, busy, passionate person. And hungry. As mentioned in a previous review, I have unorthodox ways of eating. I eat my burger bunless. If you know me, you'll realize when I like something, I like it all the time. ALL the time. Carrots, for instance, are a daily staple. Salsa and fresh food tickle my tummy. They make my GI tract happy, my tastebuds sing, and I feel like I\"ve made a great life choice. Naturally, I would want alot of it, exclusively. Chipotle delivers, judgement free. OK: Chipotle from front door entry to exit and how it's a 5 star experience (if you're me). Walk in: the place is cool, crisp, clean, open, bright. This is imagery of a 'cleansed and ready' appetite. Competitors are darker, cluttered and cramped which is not the 'feng shui' for good digestion. I follow the stream of people to a well-stocked line of industrious workers and good looking food. The menu is well organized and straight forward: no surprises - you're getting standard American-style Mexican cuisine, just pick your base (taco, burrito, salad, etc) and your meat (or non-meat) which just HAPPENS to be naturally fed (an unexpected win playing on my 'health conscious side' -- I cared about the environment without even trying!). Let's get to the food - that's what you're reading this for anyway. New paragraph. My choice has little variety: I eat the salad with no beans, no rice, no sour cream, no cheese, no guacomole. Extra cooked veggies and small heaps of beautiful, beautiful salsa. So why, if I have such a restricted preference, does Chipotle get 5 stars? Because they absolutely kick-'butt' in the department of 'extra salsa, extra veggies'. Further, the salsa are fresh, diverse, and well seasoned and spiced. I've had the pleasure of sampling their chips as well - a win win win for all you chip-fans! They have a lovely citrus/salty zing to them which makes the salsa pop. I fear a sour-cream laden dish would smother these fiesty yet delicate flavors right out of their perfection. But wait - as you progress through the highly efficient line and pay for your dish - it isn't over. Chipotle tabasco sauce - it's life-changing. The smoked flavor plays into the salsa (especially the corn salsa) giving it that 'base' which a dairy product would destroy. Think of the smoked tobasco as the tannins in a great cab sauv. That's waiting for you, with lemon wedges, after you pay and prepare to indulge in the best fast-mexican-food experience out there (in Ithaca). Be forewarned - your tastebuds will be dancing from the spice (but not torched so as not to taste anything). Conveniently, Yogurtland is a neighbour in this epi-center of good fast food and a terrific place to finish off that \"food crawl\" you won't soon forget. With that, Chipotle gets an EXTREMELY subjective 5 stars. Thank you Chipotle for the extra salsa.

Of course, it looks like any other Chipotle so there's not much to say here: lots of polished wood, stainless steel surfaces and warm tones.Food Review --I always like trying something new here since Chipotle has an unspoken rule that their menu is really limited to the confines of your imagination. I got a quesarrito this time, the brain-child of a quesadilla and a burrito. They melt cheese on the inside of a tortilla and then proceed to stuff your burrito with the good stuff.If you'd like to try new options at Chipotle, here are my recommendations:* Quesarrito: Quesadilla + Burrito, cheese melted inside tortilla prior to making burrito* Nachos: Grab a bag of chips and pile it with ingredients* Single Taco (They have these on the menu now!)Chipotle Tips:#1. 1/2 + 1/2 = 3/2 Ask for half-and-half meat and it's likely that you'll get more than a single serving. They'll charge you for the higher priced meat.#2. Pick your beans and after they've piled them on, ask for the other kind of beans as well. You'll nearly get double the beans since they weren't expecting it.#3. Fajita veggies are no extra charge (duh?)#4. If you want fresh Cilantro, just ask.Service Review --The brand is a strong one and each Chipotle is cut from the same mold, this one was no different. Service was the same with the usual mix of toothy-grinned assembly line workers and grouches.Overall Impression --It's GREAT that we have a Chipotle here now (the nearest one used to be an hour and a half drive up to Syracuse).

Small world, but she said it is pretty much the same as it was, but she could not comment on the food.We went. It is on a corner and reminded me of growing up in the 1950s in the upper east coast, where just about every neighborhood had taverns that were bar, restaurant and social gathering places. Children would dine with their parents, in an area separate from the bar. Was good food, everyone knew everyone else and it was not rowdy until later in the evening.Joe's looked the part, but there was only one other couple eating and two people at the bar.  But clean and well-maintained.Menu: appetizers, salads (regular and bottomless), pasta, flat breads, pizza, children's and desserts. Yep...dat's it. Basic, straight forward as I imagine Joe was in da day.We had salad with great Italian dressing (of course!). Wife is always trying eggplant parm ($14), hoping that it will not taste egg plantish (!) and is regularly disappointed. I had lasagna bolognese ($15). And after my dirty gin martini with regular olives, we had house red wine.The food was OK...nothing to write home about, but just straight up local fare. Yes, wife was 50-50 on the egg plant and I thought the lasagna was very rich with that milk soaked bolognese meat.Service was just fine. Of course the server was only dealing with two tables of two and a couple of bar patrons. Prices were a bit high, but that is Ithaca and the area.We got what we wanted and the recommendation was exactly what we were looking for and got.

I was pleasantly surprised to find that Joe's has completely revamped the menu. They have the standard run of entrees - chicken marsala, lasagna, manicotti, etc, but what I loved was that on the first page (of two), they had a list of pastas to choose from (including whole wheat!) and a choice of sauces. The choice of pastas also included tortellini and ravioli. I thought the cost for the pasta dishes reasonable ($10-14 depending on choice of pasta/sauce). I didn't take a good look at the entrees, but prices seemed to be about $15-17 or so.I had the Greens & Beans soup, which was only ok. It definitely needed some seasoning. The bottomless salad was a standard iceberg lettuce salad as others have described, and no, the dressing is not as good as it once was. The breadsticks were dry, and the only flavor seemed to come from the pile of grated cheese on top. There was no dipping sauce for them (but I don't recall them ever coming with sauce).The whole wheat pasta with creamy pesto was just what the doctor ordered, though. Pasta al dente, and the sauce tasty. Comfort food!The service was average - not terribly attentive (she forgot our waters) or fast (it took her a while to come take our orders). One thing I found a little irritating was that when she introduced herself, she also wrote her name on our paper tablecloth. I've never seen that done before, and I'm not sure I liked it. The atmosphere was too casual for date night (lights were too bright), though this was a Thursday evening.Anyway, I am giving them 4 stars, because, yay, their menu has improved, and I can now get a plate of tasty pasta at a reasonable price.", 4, 2, "vMB7YTcNXNiDEhUSF1SyeQ"], "bR_efN7hPjTH7gUP9-ZAhg": ["Yelp", "Joe\u2019s Restaurant", "5/30/2011", "Worst Italian food in Ithaca.

Felt like a nice hot bowl of spaghetti and meatballs. Went looking for same at Joe's. Didn't find it. The place was practically deserted when I arrived about 6 p.m. on a Wednesday evening. I was seated next to the restroom, but didn't complain. The waitress was pleasant and attentive. She brought the iced tea I ordered. I reached into the little container on the table for a packet of sugar. They were all stuck together, as if someone had spilled liquid on them and they just sat there and dried without being replaced.Next came the salad and breadsticks. The salad was perfectly ordinary -- iceberg lettuce, a few bits of shredded carrot, some red cabbage for color, onion rings, big hunks of cucumber, etc. Someone should move the lettuce to a warmer part of the refrigerator -- a few of the leaves were frozen. The dressing was out of a bottle (gelled and stabilized to a fare-thee-well) and way too sweet. Would it be too much trouble for the kitchen to whisk together some olive oil, a little vinegar, salt, and pepper? The breadsticks were fine. You have a choice of size when ordering anything on the menu -- regular, large, or family-size -- with prices to match. Resist the temptation to upsize no matter how hungry you think you are -- the regular portion is more than enough (believe me). Now, as for the spaghetti and meatballs, it was pretty bad. Everything was woefully underseasoned. The meatballs had no flavor whatsoever (honestly, I'm not exaggerating). I also didn't care for the texture. Some might call them extremely tender. I call them mushy (think pudding -- round, brown, flavorless pudding). The tomato sauce was equally disappointing. It was very sour, but otherwise bland -- as though someone had simply heated up a can of not very good tomatoes and dumped it over the pasta. It could've used a little of the sugar that was in the salad dressing -- and maybe a pinch of salt, some herbs, a couple cloves of garlic, a bit of sauteed onion...You know, Ithaca could really use an Olive Garden or a Macaroni Grill.

There were only two mussel shells on the dish, and one was empty (with the mussel it should have contained nowhere to be found elsewhere in the dish).

The menu features a good range of cuisine and price points, including a squadron of small plates, as well as entrees between about $15 and $30. We got out of there with dinner for three, including two plates of naan, for under $60 before tip.

Overall - cool ideas, questionable execution.ATMOSPHERE & SERVICE: Looks fantastic, feels great. The service was on point, no complaints.Let's talk about food...1. Ahi Tuna Salad: Fresh greens, the yuzu soy dressing isn't bad. Decent portion - be aware that the Ahi is 3 thin slices which are well seared on the edges but nicely raw in the center. A totally decent salad, but nothing special. 8/102. Roast duck puff pastry samosa:Comes with a tamarind-mango sauce and what I believe was a chutney with whole mustard seeds. The problem is that puff pastry is rich and butter, combined with the sauces which were very sweet, and the rich and heavy filling - this was just dense and unbalanced. Furthermore, the duck in the filling felt like it had been braised for a lot time to the point of toughness. 7/103. Alaskan Crabmeat & Vietnamese Sausage Wontons:Disappointing. The filling lacked the sweetness of crab but also didn't really have any significant savoriness or any flavors that reminded me of vietnamese flavors. The soup was decent. There were 5 or 6 very small wontons in this portion. I just felt like the main attraction here, the filling of the dumplings, did not deliver. 6/104. Pan-seared Tandoori Quail:The quail was tough. I tried cutting it with my knife and it didn't work. I resorted to picking it up by hand and biting it directly. Also, the spice blend on the outside of the quail was passable but they had completely forgotten to salt the quail. The quail also lacked any browning or maillard flavors, it just felt like the spice blend had been stuck on. The spices didn't taste particularly well toasted or bloomed prior to being rubbed on. The raita on the other hand, was thicker than usual and saltier than usual. Solid concept, perhaps, but poor execution. 5/105. Passion Fruit Frozen Souffle:First off, this is a big portion. The passion fruit flavor isn't bad, but they may have oversweetened the base as the brightness isn't as punchy as a great passionfruit dessert is. This is fairly hard, but not that dense. Frozen souffle is a fairly apt description, I suppose. I would guess that the recipe is for a semifreddo. The raspberry sauce (we had no caviar) was completely forgettable - tasted like the raspberry gel on a supermarket cake. There was also some sort of brittle on top which was tasty, but just didn't mesh well with the rest of the dessert. Also, for a frozen \"souffle,\" I think I'd prefer something that retains the texture of a souffle as to be honest, we spent the first minute or so attempting to dig into the top like digging into a hard frozen pint of ice cream.

It came with some odd mango sauce with chia seeds in it and a sauce that was indistinguishable from tatziki from a cheap greek diner. The kabob was also cold. The \"pork bun\" was not a pork bun at all. It was a steamed dough bun, in a taco shape, wrapped around pork belly cooked in what appeared to be chef yoshida sauce from Cotsco. Despite the fact it was actually not a pork bun it was pretty good. I got a butter chicken masala as well. It tasted like it was made without ghee and the chicken appeared to be boiled not sauteed.

Not the case here. Our waiter aggressively avoided coming near us, ignoring us when I tried to get an update on our meal. I asked the woman at the front if I could talk to a manager and she said there was no manager there. I asked her if she could have our waiter stop by the table. She was able to track him down.

At this point, 90 minutes in, we needed to leave. Rather than just walking out, I wanted to let the waiter know so asked once again if the woman who seated us could find our waiter. His only comment was were we going to pay for the salad and one appetizer that had come out in 90 minutes. Stupidly, I said yes. Two tables next to me were stunned at the lack of basic service and professionalism and questioned why I would pay for anything after being treated so poorly.

There was no taste of real ginger. There was candied ginger in the salad, which did not really go with the other flavors. The dressing had no taste of ginger. (2) Vegetable samosas: these were OK, but tasted like they came from a box.(3) Lotus Root Fritters: these are completely tasteless until you put the bottled chili sauce on them. This is the same chili sauce that we buy in Wegmans and it completely overpowered the fritters. We tried the fritters without the chili sauce and then just tasted an oily and under-seasoned fritter.

I have had better but I would definitely return just for the pork buns!I went here for dinner after months of anticipation based on all the good reviews and the familiarity with the owner's other restaurants. I have to say that the food was a bit hit and miss. I wanted to see how a diverse number of dishes was prepared, so my friend and I had a number of dishes from the left side of the menu. Our line up consisted of tom kha gai, raw sampler, crispy duck roll, BBQ pork buns, foie gras, and baby back ribs. Lets get the bad news out of the way. The tom kha was way too sour and rather thin in terms of texture and amounts of ingredients. The foie was pretty disappointing, thus ruining my perfect streak of awesome foie dishes. The foie was cold with no sear on the outside to add a level of texture and flavor that I am used to. It was also pretty awkward to navigate the dish as the puff pastry on the bottom was very tough and hard to cut through without demolishing the delicate foie. I don't think the baby back ribs were even baby backs. They tasted like spare ribs, and much like the foie, they were inexcusably cold. They were tender but not enough to effortlessly fall off the bone like I am used to. The flavors were satisfyingly and distinctively umami, though. Now the good part! The pork bun was a pleasure to eat and the number one reason why I can't wait to go back for another round. The bun was perfectly steamy and soft. The pork was extremely well prepared and the crispiness contrasted with the softness of the bun. The daikon provided a third texture to the dish that was all tied together with the sauce. This dish was fantastic and definitely the best item on the menu that we had. The raw sampler was very well prepared as well. All three fish were wonderfully fresh and paired with sauces that synergized each bite. I really appreciated the translucent ruby color of the ahi tuna. The only aspect of this dish that I wish was different was the presentation. It was hard to share this dish as it was served in tasting spoons. Otherwise, it was perfect. The crispy duck rolls had lots of great flavors with the freshness of the herbs playing a large part in the flavor profile. The roll itself was thick enough to give the dish substance and was fried perfectly crispy. For all dishes, the presentation was simple and clean, which was a great example of how less is more.The interior of Mia is very well done. There are plenty of colors that are stimulating and simply just work. It is a tasteful mix of different designs elements and colors that makes your eyes wander. The one aspect that I thought was really interesting were the tables. They edges were tapered to give an impression that they were wafer thin and delicate. I just thought it was pretty clever.The service here was OK. Our server was training someone and really didn't explain the menu very much, which is OK, but some introduction would have been nice. The pace was pretty good but they brought out our 6 dishes in two rounds of 3. The table was a bit crowded. I also think the duck roll took a bit longer to fire so the foie and ribs may have been sitting in the back, hence why they were cold when they arrived.I would have liked to have given 4 stars but the cold and sometimes awkward dishes dropped it to 3.

As expected, there's a certain level of class to the atmosphere and it felt both very romantic and comfortable at the same time.I had the most dangerous drink ever to start - a passion fruit caiproska that was way too delicious for a lightweight drinker like myself. Best part of the meal by far were the bbq pork buns - my hubby actually ordered those but I practically ate the whole plate myself. I was there for apps only, so I had a raw fish sampler, the scallop dumplings, and the duck rolls. Both the pork buns and the scallop dumplings were clever - deconstructed in a way that made the protiens shine more and have great texture. A+ for both. The roll part of the duck rolls trumped their actual filling, which was good but not that special. Raw fish is raw fish, though it wasn't served in a way I would have chosen - diced rather finely and a little hard to actually eat (either with the chopsticks, the fork, or even right out of the spoons they are served in). Hubby had a pork entree, which I cannot review as I didn't get to try it, as he practially licked his plate clean!For dessert I had some kind of marscapone and strawberry and puff pastry layered thing.

Starters run about $10 a piece, and for a $10 order of crispy duck rolls I expect more than 3 tiny duck rolls that can be eaten in 2 bites a piece. Mains run about $20 a-pop and there the problem isn't the serving size, which is decent, it is the quality of the food. The dishes here are not significantly better than what you can get in any of the other good alternatives in town such as Sticky Rice, Tamarind or Taste of Thai. We had the duck rolls, mussels, thai spicy seafood and the prig pow moo, and the Prig Pow Moo was decent but kind of a one note dish that consisted of just pork in sauce with no vegetables or anything to break up the monotony while the seafood was overcooked with rubbery prawns and scallops. The duck rolls were not particularly exciting either, as they were prepared in such a way that they barely tasted of duck at all. Still, it was edible, so that earns Mia its second star. Where Mia loses and loses big is with the quality of the service and the overall value. First was when the waiter came to take away our dishes from our appetizers, he picked up our chopsticks and basically threw them down on the bare table with an audible clatter before proceeding to spill some broth from our mussels onto the table while removing the dish. Did he come back to wipe off that broth? No, he didn't even notice, obviously busier with more important tables than ours. Second, when he took our main dishes away, he practically stabbed me in the arm passing by with the silverware. I'm not one to make a fuss, but I'm lucky I was wearing a black t-shirt and not a nice dress shirt which would have got ruined by his carelessness. On top of those errors, he was rude and short with us, making it seem like we were wasting his time by eating in the restaurant. The bottom line for me is that when my bill came I felt like I had been ripped off. That's a feeling I don't get when I go to a pricier restaurant in town like Just a Taste or Fine Line Bistro.

And let's be honest, when you can't cook a portabello mushroom correctly, should you really be in the culinary business? I might be willing to overlook some negatives in the dining experience if the waitstaff are actually kind and courteous. But no, at mia it's the standard ithaca approach of 'clearly i am better than waiting on you at a restaurant, but i'm taking this job until i find something else.' I particularly enjoyed the entire staff not knowing what the hell to do when the fire alarm started going off. Considering the history of structural fires on the commons, I actually take fire alarms seriously, and would hope that the management would inform and educate their staff to do the same.And asking a restaurant to play good music is always asking too much, but can you at least not play horrible, I mean HORRIBLE, elevator smooth jazz mixed with crappy adult contemporary?So, no, I won't ever go back there.

Many of us had the lamb dish and we were blown away with Lex's (owner) creation. There was plenty of food. The owner's wife is a pastry chef and we were told that all desserts were homemade. We ordered five of the desserts so we all could sample the variety. Each was better than the last. The pistachio kofti was soft and delicious. The creme brule trio was warm and rich in flavors. The chocolate bombe had a real hit of raspberry that was so pleasing. The coffee was very good and the wine selection was varied and appropriate. I went again two nights ago, just for dessert and coffee. Although we were only having dessert, we were seated quickly and our business was treated as importantly as a dinner customer. My daughter and I shared 3 desserts (!) and they were as good as opening night. We were not rushed through, in fact, we lingered for quite some time, finishing our coffee, after our desserts were gone. I had the same Turkish waiter we had in June and he remembered my friend.

After that service was swift and adequate. The fried haddock sandwich I received was fitted with a nice, if a little greasy cut of fish. The tomato and lettuce were fresh and crisp but the bun was woefully dull. Spongy, a little damp and not convincing that it was baked anywhere near the place or time it was being consumed. Pricing: Alcohol pricing seemed a bit high. I was also a bit disappointed with the onion rings. At a charge of an extra $2 I was expecting more than 5 rings and felt I would have been better off sticking with the included fries.All in all not terrible.

FOOD: good, hearty meals that come in sizable portions. A quick run through of what I've tried: the Shepherd's pie was heavy, filling, and tasty. It was kind of blunt in term of flavors, but I think that's kind of what I like about the soul-food-iness of shepherd's pie in general. The Grilled Chicken and Brie is pretty delicious and filling. I like the Brie, instead of say Havarti or something, because it did not overpower the red-wine-marinated chicken (which is moist and flavorful) while still adding that creamy richness that I love about brie. Surprisingly, the lightly toasted asiago loaf adds a lot to the whole shebang. The Corned Beef and Cabbage was decent; the corned beef was all I could ask for and more when it comes to corned beef, but the cabbage didn't add much. I know, cabbage is usually just a light side to offset the heavy meat, but I think cabbage can still bring a fresh palate cleanser to the meal. In this case, not really. The dish was, however, still quite good. The Kilpatrick's Grilled Chicken Breast is also quite good. It was the first dish I ever got, so I don't remember it will, but it was one of the reasons I came back, if that says anything. Note --- there are some good vegetarian options, not just side salads! I brought my vegetarian friend who usually hates \"bar food\" but she really liked this place (vegetable sandwich, butternut squash ravioli, etc). DRINKS: Good selection of beers, nice selection of whiskeys, and okay selection for other drinks (not that the other drinks should really matter if you're headed to a pub, right?). I didn't really notice their wine selection, so I can't comment on that. I like the taster of four different kinds of beer if you're in the mood to try new stuff (the four glasses come on a, what else, wooden shamrock). They also have some good, cheap specials ($3 Red Ale) if you want quantity over quality. SERVICE: Not too bad. I think the last server we had was kind of new. She was very attentive. When we asked for another few minutes to look at the menu, she literally came back three or four times, with almost exactly one minute in between each return. We just wanted to take our time and we felt rushed and bad for sending her away so much. She also couldn't remember the specials, didn't know too much about the menu, and couldn't remember the beers on tap or bottled beer. The time before, the waitress was really good and friendly. She knew all the beers on tap (there were a lot) and knew the specials like the back of her hand. AMBIANCE: I really like it. Private booths in back, very homey and private, snug when you need it to be, while also being surprisingly roomy and good for small groups (about 6). Loved it. In the front, there was a much more pub-like feel. I really like the overall feeling, with the mid-darker wood, warm lighting, and gridded windows. I kind of forgot I was in Ithaca...oh the joy. RANDOM ISSUE: I want them to make up a base drinks menu. I'm sure there are some beers they ALWAYS have, so why not just let us look at those and then fill us in on the specials or whatever? Sometimes I have trouble ordering when I'm bombarded by fifteen or something different available beers.

Next, the manager came out to insist that it \"wasn't blood, it was probably vinegar\" in a tone that was a lot more combative than reassuring. I wasn't surprised to see that they left without eating anything else. I had already ordered, and I believed the rude manager that there wasn't blood on the lettuce, so I stuck around for my souvlaki.While waiting, I saw another server sneeze on her hands and then pick up a rag to wipe tables down... so that wasn't nice. I later saw her carrying a water pitcher around with her hands touching the lip. Ick.When my food came, I asked the server where they sourced their lettuce, since I'm a little wary after the E. coli outbreak caused by Yuma lettuce. The server didn't know, so she said she would check. She came back to tell me that she couldn't find that information and I guess I still looked hesitant because she then ran off to find the manager. Next thing I know, the same rude manager is standing very close to me, smelling strongly of cigarettes, and telling me (condescendingly) that no restaurant distribution supply would send out bad lettuce. (Of course they would, by accident, that's how there was an outbreak in the first place!). All the manager had to do was tell the server that the lettuce was from Texas, but she decided to make it a much bigger deal than it needed to be. I suspect she was still miffed from the blood incident and asking a question made me a problem customer in her eyes.

The pasta dishes run you around $12-14 AND there's an upcharge of around $4 to add meat AND an upcharge for certain types of pasta, so you can easily drop close to $20 for a pasta dish.

There were 5 of us: My roommate, me, and our parents who were visiting us for the weekend. We were simply looking for an enjoyable dining experience since we do not see our parents often. Once we ordered the food we waited an hour for it to arrive. We mentioned that fact to our waitress, and she told us it was only 40 minutes (it was definitely an hour), and they can't help it because there were big parties. However, at that point we were the only people in the restaurant along with maybe 20 other people max, the other parties had left a good 30 minutes prior. The food eventually arrived, and we requested extra dressing for the salads ordered since there was a very small amount included. (Later to find that there was a 50 cent extra charge for each extra dressing ordered). While 50 cents is nothing, it was not explained prior to ordering it that it would cost extra, which is very poor.Once we received the bill we noticed the extra charge on the dressing and asked our waitress why it was extra since we had never experienced that before, and why we waited an hour for our food to come out. The waitress responded by walking away and saying it wasn't her fault very rudely. We called her back to the table and asked to speak with the owner.A lady came up to the table, who was very clearly not the owner, and listened to our concerns. We were very calm and polite while explaining our frustrations and she repeatedly told us that the dressing was homemade (it was literally oil and vinegar), and that is why it was extra. She then told us that she was sorry and that she would take the complaints into consideration, and that was it. It was very evident that she couldn't care less about how our experience was.The food was not great to begin with, but it could have been made better with quality service.

She also complained about giving us individual bills since, for some reason, it was extremely challenging to do at Aladdin's.

They were closing shop early (8:45pm), so when we got there at 8:15pm, all the chairs had been put away and not a soul was in sight. The dining area is interesting, split between two levels by staircases. It's definitely not your coziest or most comfortable spot (the chairs are only lightly padded metal).Food Review --The Souvlaki Plate was essentially a salad with a few pieces of beef scattered here and there (see picture). The bland beef and cold pita slices were unsatisfying. The cherry tomatoes were fresh but it didn't help that the lettuce was dry and the other veggies didn't have much personality. The rest of the group's dishes were just as disappointing.Service Review --Since the kitchen was winding down, I thought our food might take a while, but it came out rather quickly. It was obvious that the hostess and server wanted us to leave as soon as possible. Service was mediocre, we didn't receive any of the usual \"how is everything?\" or \"would you like a refill of water?\"Overall Impression --This was my second time at Aladdins, and it pains me to say that this is a place I hope I don't have to eat at again. The prices here at Aladdins were ridiculous. The Souvlaki Plate was $12.95, plus our group gratuity, tax and tip, my total came out to $18.

Ok, and my second favourite thing (because robust as it may have been, I could never live with myself if I routinely ordered a salad as a meal) is the basil pesto pasta, usually with the portabello ravioli. I used to cut the raviolis diagonally twice, and eat them in triangular quarters, to maximize the length of my eating experience, and to make sure I savoured, not scarfed.They also have excellent veggie chili (HOT and HEARTY!) and lemonade. And they have the best, richest desserts. I don't think they make them, I think they bring them in from somewhere (next door?), but who cares where they got them. They are always visually enticing, and gustatorially tantalizing. MMMMMMM. As I recall, the midnight cake was my favourite.AND!! I remember coming after slope day! That was the best.

For lunch, my recommendation is to go with whatever is on special and be sure to get a soup. You can get a soup in lieu of a side which can make for a cheaper and healthier meal.If you go on a Saturday for breakfast, expect a bit of a wait as it will be packed.

It's that simple. They have a vat of liquid crack cocaine and they pour the vanilla-esque creamish product in there and swirl it until it's cold and then they pipe it onto a cone and watch as the soccer moms and administrative assistants and truck drivers and bricklayers and hairstylists drive through the drive thru with crumbs still on their shirtfronts and blouses from the cone they just got up the road at the OTHER McDonalds and devoured on their way down the hill on route 13, or up the hill, in case they are hitting the Elmira Road McDonalds' first and then the Triphammer one.The worst day of my life, the machine was broken: at both mcDonalds.So I drove to Dryden.I really hope this doesn't demean me in the eyes of you other fro-yo connoisseurs and connoisettes out there... but a person has to start somewhere... and seriously... you know you have a guilty bad-food habit you admit to no one. You love Jif peanut butter, or you drink Postum... or maybe... maybe you like Goobers (either the PB&J mix in the jar OR the chocolate-covered movie theater peanuts it doesn't matter!), or maybe its Potted Meat you love or even... even Vienna Sausages.yeah, so before you start tossing cans of spam or ambrosia salad molds at me just remember...

Considering that my friends and I just came from the gym and were starving to the point of ready to eat anything and everything, Mitsuba's chinese food is beyond hopelessness. Perhaps being the self-aware restaurant that Mitsuba is, they sprinkle in their menu the Pad Thai dish as their saving grace. More likely though they just put Pad Thai in due to its popularity. I made the silly mistake of assuming that they know how to cook Pad Thai and ordered one. The chef made it too salty, too sweet, and too sour, and no chilly. It is as if the chef thinks that by putting more of everything in he will make the dish magically tastes better. Their pad thai costing around $9 is said to be \"plain,\" and the waiter said we need to ask for the meat to be added. It is only after we got the bill that we know \"plain\" is codeword for paying $4 extra for 5 pieces of chicken, each was about the size of a baby's finger. Their Pad Thai ultimately cost 13$, other Pad Thai in better located restaurants tops at $10.  The utter failure of their szechuan dishes are perhaps rivaled only by the miserableness of their \"Japanese\" dishes. Each dish cost an arm and a leg. And the chef demonstrated his utter ignorance about sushi and Japanese cuisine in general by mixing and matching the ingredients that have nothing to do with one another. But our party's trial and tribulations were not over. After asking for a check, we received the check with a wrong amount. We called the waitress, and got blamed because one of our friend left early and has paid for his meal. They failed to account for that and now could not figure out how to modify the check, so I guess the only sensible solution is to blame the customers. All in all please don't go.", 1, 1, "D-JhGP70jgfI9k58M5azMA"], "0Ookwej90Cc8TlA78zXa8Q": ["Yelp", " Mitsuba", "1/23/2016", "I want to start off with saying it hurts me to give this restaurant a low score. I was traveling to Ithaca for a one day trip. I've done a bit of research and wanted to find the best sushi Ithaca has to offer and found this place. Having coming in around 4pm on a Friday, there was only a few tables seated inside. As I sat down, I've noticed there was a 2nd menu which was filled with Chinese dishes. On the menu, it literally says \"Mitsuba Japanese Cuisine.\" First impressions was confusion with a Chinese menu, and Thai dishes such as the Tom Yum Soup for example. Another observation was the drink/dessert menus weren't wiped down and literally had dried soy sauce spots on them. As I'm looking through the Japanese menu, I was searching for the a la carte section (Nigiri). I was told it was on the take-out menu so here comes a 3rd menu if I wanted Nigiri. There are a couple errors on the take-out menu such as \"Salmon\" being spelled \"Sakmon.\" Also, it states on the take-out menu that Happy Hour is 3:00pm - 5:30pm but on the plastic stand that sits on the table it states 3:30pm - 6:00pm. I also want to point out there is literally a picture of a hibachi table on the menu. There isn't a single actual hibachi table inside the restaurant. A complimentary volcano roll was given to us, which was 3 pieces and mainly rice. Suspicions rose and I asked what the volcano roll was filled with and I was told \"white fish.\" A very unnoticeable amount of \"white fish\" was found inside the roll and it only tasted of deep fried rice. Though complimentary, I could have done without. So I wanted to start off with the Shumai and Gyoza. The Shumai came out barely lukewarm, and came with an overly strong sauce. I'm not shy of strong sauces, but this will hit your sinuses and make you lightheaded. The Gyoza was actually quite tasty. The filling was tender, and the was nicely done. I then ordered Nigiri which consisted of Scallop, Super-White Tuna, Yellow-Tail, Salmon, Tuna, Mackerel, Sweet Shrimp and Ikura (Salmon Roe). I think the Yellow-Tail, Super-White Tuna, and Scallop were the highlights. The Tuna was just alright. The Salmon was odd to me. It looked fresh in colour, but tasted off. The Mackerel and Ikura had to be the biggest disappointment. The colour of the Mackerel was off, and very dry. The Ikura is the worst I've had. Old Ikura is what I had. To the point where the shell or skin of each roe would literally stick to the inside of your teeth. As for the Sweet Shrimp, didn't taste quite fresh. Onto the rolls. I ordered the Mitsuba Lobster, Crazy Eel, and Paradise. What really gets me, is the menu is loaded with pictures left and right. Beautiful professional looking pictures of the rolls and how they're plated. None of the rolls were presented the way it looked in the pictures. I must say, once the Paradise Roll and Nigiri came out my mind was blown. I was astonished seeing how this was plated. It looked incredible, and I absolutely loved it. Seeing the effect on the plate really blew me away. But unfortunately came with a price. I noticed a thin strand growing out of the middle of the plastic flower. At first, I was really hoping it was a fiber from one of the petals but I was wrong. Not only was it a dark colour, but it was without a doubt a hair. As I started to pull it out, it kept getting longer and longer to the point where I actually pulled the plastic flower out of the cup hanging by the hair. I called the Host over and showed him and he apologized and took away the flower. The Crazy Eel and Mitsuba Lobster Roll came out and they were tasty and I have no complaints. After the meal, he came over and asked if we wanted dessert and we declined. He brought over the bill and told me he took off 10% for what has happened. From being confused entering a Japanese Cuisine restaurant with a Chinese menu and Thai dishes, to dirty menus, to a hair being dead center of the plate. I'm very saddened to give this restaurant such a low score because I see potential. The presentation is phenomenal and I truly feel the chef is creative and skillful making sushi. Unfortunately, the best way I can describe this restaurant is it's a beautiful car with a bad engine. The engine needs some tweaking and this would be a great restaurant. ---Food---*NIGIRI*Scallop: 8.5/10Super-White Tuna: 9/10Yellow-Tail: 8.5/10Salmon: 7.5/10Tuna: 7/10Mackerel: 3/10Ikura: 1/10Sweet Shrimp: 5/10*ROLLS*Mitsuba Lobster: 8.5/10Paradise: 8/10Crazy Eel: 7/10 Presentation: 10/10---Restaurant---Atmosphere: 8/10Decoration: 9/10Cleanliness: 6/10", 2, 10, "D-JhGP70jgfI9k58M5azMA"], "Ph_UCViy-kwSqVAAAiuVsA": ["Yelp", " Mitsuba", "12/11/2015", "I am so glad that me and my husband decided to try this place!

There was no offer of the specials, or mention made of the happy hour specials. We had just noticed the card on the table that offered half price appetizers and beer. After about 20 times of being asked if we were ready to order, we ordered and waited for our dinner to arrive. When it finally did we found the sushi not fresh, the beers not cold and the service for us seemed different than it did for the others in the place. No mention of the salad bar. No mention of tea yet all other tables got a pot. We observed that we were the only two white women in the place and that seriously made us wonder if that was the reason for the lack of attention after the order was placed was due to that fact. When we got the bill, we noticed all of the happy hour specials were rung up as full price, so we had to figure that out before we could leave. As we left we asked if they had a Sichuan menu and they pointed to the sign in the front entrance that is not written in both Chinese and English. We spied there was a full menu inside and quickly took a look at it and thought we would give them another try and check out the Sichuan next time. The second and last time we visited, we had just the opposite service with the wait staff leaving the menus on the table and then never returning. It took forever to get drinks, again, no offer of salad bar, happy hour specials, or tea. This time we picked up the Sichuan menu as that is what we wanted to try, however it was not offered to us. The dish I ordered was a fish in spicy sauce and it was not real spicy, and had not one Sichuan peppercorn, therefore no \"mala\", no \"wok hey\". While I may not be Asian, I want real Asian food when I go out to eat, not any Americanized Asian food. So we were both incredibly disappointed in the food, again, and also in the service again as well. And once again, we observed different treatment for us as compared to others in the restaurant. So, due to this treatment and the decline of the freshness of fish and the not authentic Sichuan, we shall not be re-visiting Mitsuba and shall get our Sushi fix elsewhere.

Like I said before, when we go out to eat, we expect the cuisine to be representative of the country it comes from, not some Americanized version, and we also expect the service to be the same across the board for all customers.", 1, 4, "D-JhGP70jgfI9k58M5azMA"], "-XO0_JyYVNesY5kHGt_PRA": ["Yelp", " Mitsuba", "12/10/2014", "I have been on a sushi kick for weeks now, so when the craving hit I decided to head to the place with the highest number of great reviews! Mitsuba is a relatively new place; none of my coworkers had heard of it and even during the dinner hours they were almost empty. Obviously this was just fine with me as I didn't have to wait to sit down and my food was out fairly quickly.The place itself is nice. It's very spacious and the set up is generally attractive, though nothing special. This is your standard dining hall look, so might not be right for a romantic night out.The service is good, albeit a little weird. None of the servers really engaged with us from the moment we came in, until we left. They asked only the most perfunctory questions and avoided eye contact. I'm chalking it up to a cultural difference? Other than that, however, everything was very nicely done. We got hot towels for our hands (especially nice when it's freezing and snowy outside!) Soon after sitting down, we were surprised to get a free volcano roll. Unfortunately, my friend and I are both vegetarian so we had to send it back, but the gesture is awesome! Finally, as I mentioned, the food was out fairly quickly.Note that you will not get tea with your meal as is so frequently the case in Japanese restaurants. For whatever reason, Mitsuba only offers water. You can, of course, order tea, but it's always a nice little perk to get it for free. Not a big deal, just something to keep in mind.The vegetarian rolls all looked very appetizing, so I had a hard time deciding and ended up getting four rolls: the avocado peanut, avocado cucumber, sweet potato, and the house vegetable maki. The first three were excellent and I would highly recommend them. The house vegetable maki was a little weird, but it could just be personal taste. Since this was the most expensive roll, I was disappointed that it was not my favorite, but it was no big deal. I think something about the melange of vegetables just didn't work for me. The price is completely on par with other sushi restaurants and way cheaper than Wegman's, so nothing to complain about there.One thing that I noticed and really liked was Mistuba's reciprocity with yelp. If a customer writes a review, they get a free appetizer, checking in usually results in some sort of freebie (in my case it was a miso soup); in short, using yelp will get you tons of good deals here!

It is only $5.50 a dozen and they are cooked perfectly every time. I usually get the hot Ralph's wings. They are pretty hot but not remorsefully or painfully hot so that sauce is a winner in my book.

Thus, let us assay the Rhine House with a most critical and discerning eye. First, we must acknowledge that a bar's aesthetic is the very soul of its being. Thusly, to delineate both the intent and consequence of an aesthetic--and to determine their alignment--is to unmask the de facto efficacy of said establishment. In this sense, we find the Rhine House situated firmly and unabashedly in its ethos - neither pretentious nor unnecessarily humble, the aesthetic belies the very same earnestness of its soul. One of its patrons (on which I shall speak presently) might refer to such an atmosphere as \"Fine, whatever. Just a local bar,\" by which we can corroborate that it is indeed the very quintessence of candid self-actualization... the ding an sich.Next, it is only fitting that we turn to the common patronage of an establishment in order to gain a sense of its proverbial terroir. For what else is a bar if not the corporeal presence of a community's ethereal (though nonetheless substantial) identity? If the Rhine House is any microcosm of its greater community, then it does the town a service in its facade. Eschewing whatever negative connotations we might attach to a meaningless label of \"diversity,\" the actual diversity of the Rhine House's clientele is a refreshing slice of humanity's imperfections and accomplishments alike. Were I a layman, unconcerned with the ambiguities of clich\u00e9 adages, I might daresay the place is down-to-earth.Penultimately, let us recognize that the staff of this establishment have little tolerance for nonsense and a large tolerance for everything else. Should an inebriated hooligan attempt to incite a furor among those around him, I have little doubt that s/he would be dealt with swiftly and uncompromisingly (for the good of the order, of course). Conversely, the same barkeeps do well to humor others in their trivial conversations, no matter how many iterations of the same topics and questions have been drunkenly thrown at their direction, perhaps in an attempt at quelling--or at least fleetingly mitigating--the encroaching loneliness of life. Finally, it would only be fitting to note the variety of spirits available and the financial burdens thereunto. Stated plainly, the variety of ales and liquors is adequate; the variety of wines is unsurprisingly limited, yet considerable in quality. Among all options, cost is no greater factor than one should expect (at worst) or, on some nights and for some particular libations, exceedingly fair (at best). In total, I would estimate that all manners of person from all manners of occupation could afford both the literal cost and the company involved in such an outing.Please pardon any errors or idiosyncrasies in this screed - English is but my eighth language.P.S.

So vegans will take a 2 hour trip to try out the next vegan spot and explore how the new place \"does Vegan\". I feel Strong Hearts (Syracuse) had a little too much influence on their menu board. Just my opinion. I was really hoping I would have had the opportunity to try something completely different. Some may argue the food there is different but changing a few sauces or ingredients in the already same wraps and sandwiches isn't different in my mind. But keep up the good work. I want EVERY vegan eatery to succeed and thrive which in case Ten Forward Cafe certainly has that ability. Maybe consider a better location when things start to get going a bit better?

I could have a knife held to my balls and I'd still call it a friggin' chicken burrito. But that's just my personal opinion.Otherwise, the employees are generally good at what they do. One gentleman with a ponytail and glasses (I think?) is always particularly friendly and always smiling.

The restaurant is indeed not cheap; however, considering the expenses the restaurant has to pay for the transportation of all the fresh ingredients to upstate New York, it is indeed not a bad deal for students who are tired of eating greasy pizzas, burgers, and fries. In addition, the quality of the food accounts for the price. Both the seafood and vegetables used in their dishes are fresh. Not only do they use fresh ingredients, Miyake is known to have some the best Japanese dishes in town making them one of the most popular restaurants among students. Due to such a positive reputation, Miyake currently supplies sushi to Mac's Caf\u00e9, located in Statler Hall, on a daily basis for Cornell students to enjoy a Japanese meal at a more convenient location. Not only does Miyake have fresh quality food, but it also has a variety of menu options. The restaurant offers a large variety of Japanese cuisine from sushi, rolls, udon, gyoza, to sashimi. Many refuse to go to restaurants with a wide range of menus believing that they don't provide quality food; yet, Miyake is different. With great cross utilization of ingredients, the restaurant offers a variety of quality gourmets that most people would enjoy. Some of the most famous dishes at Miyake include the Crazy Boy Roll and the Super Bowl. In fact, the Crazy Boy Roll is one of the most authentic dishes at Miyake where the crab and avocado sushi roll is fried and topped with savory thick soy sauce. On the other hand, the Super Bowl is a combination of assorted sashimi, lettuce, crunches, and Miyake's special sauce in a bowl creating an authentic Miyake style main course meal.Miyake not only excels in the food itself, but also in their level of service. The waiters seem to be well trained. When you first sit down at the table, the server will instantly serve you with ice water along with your menu. They also ask whether you would prefer a hot cup of green tea to melt down from the chilly weather of Ithaca. The food is then delivered about 10 minutes after ordering. When the food is served, the waiter brings over extra plates allowing you to share the food if you would like. Thus, the service at Miyake is quick and they attempt to serve any additional needs before you ask them.In addition to the great service, the d\u00e9cor of the restaurant enhances your dining experience. Miyake is not the top-notch restaurant with fancy decorations. However, the simple red and wood tone colors and the sushi bar incorporated offer a cozy traditional Japanese look and feeling. For those who place an emphasis on the sanitization of the restaurant, all the tables are wiped and the bathrooms are clean for use. Indeed, Miyake isn't a flawless restaurant. In fact, they did have some minor issues with the order in which they serve food and the saltiness. For instance, Miyake once served the main dish before the appetizer--not the best choice a restaurant could make. Yet, such mistakes could have been a one-time occurrence. One of the long-term problems of Miyake would be the saltiness of the food. Some of the plates such as the Spicy Yaki Udon and Super Bowl seemed overly salty. Especially for student from the millennial generation who attempts to eat healthier, such salty dishes are not the best attractions. Despite these minor drawbacks, Miyake is the restaurant to visit as it offers some of the best quality and fresh Japanese dishes in town along with appreciable service and menu variety.", 4, 0, "8Zoh-M0oIQZ-uI3cpQ8bBg"], "2YMYC7BdOhxZNSZGD_r9Og": ["Yelp", "Miyake Japanese Restaurant", "4/14/2014", "I only come here on Tuesdays cause they have specials for their sushi.

The restaurant is nothing fancy which is fine by me, as I have learned that fancy decor is not necessarily a reflection on quality of food. We walked in to a big open room filled with various tables. They had a few round tables which I like, especially when you are dining with several other people, as it is conducive for conversation and no one feels like they are \"sitting on the end.\" It will say it was freezing in there so we all left our coats on. They had a small single electric heater sitting on a table in the middle of the restaurant for heat.Ordered fresh and fried spring rolls. Fresh were good, nothing special. Fried were the same. Some were dark brown and some were light brown which was odd - I assume that the dark ones were perhaps pre-fried, and then fried again before serving. My daughter and I somewhat nervously ordered the Pho and kept our fingers crossed. I absolutely love Pho and have it at any opportunity I can get it. Again, it was ok - broth needed more flavor, and not a lot of meat, which was a tad on the tough side as I think it had been in the broth longer than it should have been. I had to add a lot of Sriracha sauce to it. My husband and son had the lemongrass chicken noodle bowls which again were ok. My son said his had very little flavor so they ended up asking for some extra of the fish sauce that comes with it to kick up the flavor. My son's girlfriend had Chinese beef and broccoli which was average. Food: just plain averagePrice: a little on the high side. It was $90+ dollars for 5 of us, not including the tip. Service: server was very nice and apologetic for the slow service, and the food was very slow coming out of the kitchen.Menu: if they are going to advertise as a Vietnamese restaurant they need more Vietnamese menu choices, as the majority is Chinese.

No, there might not be as many as in, say, San Francisco, but I can think of a good handful, and for a town of Ithaca's size, what more would you expect? If you want fancy, or are looking to impress someone, and can make it to John Thomas or The Heights, by all means do so. But Banfi's will work in a pinch if you are on campus.I've only been for dinner once, and I suppose the conditions predisposed me to having a positive experience regardless...it was free, on the tab of some alumni. The food, in my opinion, was quite good; I started with a goat cheese, prosciutto, and apricot flatbread, followed by the duck two ways (confit and roasted breast), and finished with a flourless chocolate torte. No complaints here, everything was as expected and delicious, with no errors in preparation or presentation. I'm not sure what I was thinking ordering duck confit in a Tuscan restaurant, but it turned out well. My tablemates had varying experiences: several were less than impressed with the strip steak, one approved of the rack of lamb, and another raved about that night's Chilean sea bass special. I've also heard concensus reports from others that their gnocchi and pasta dishes are excellent, and I would generally say that, given the theme of the place, these would always be safe bets. The wine list was extensive, and the server, while a student (yes, this is at a university, to those of you who seem surprised by this), was very knowledgeable. I will say that the service was EXTREMELY slow even though there was not much of a crowd. I don't know what they were doing in the kitchen but they were doing it slowly. Prices were generally high, expect to pay a lot for not much food.So you may be wondering why four stars at this point, and I hope I haven't lost the readers' attention. Because, the reason for those four stars, a reason which none of the previous reviewers have mentioned, in fact the true reason why Banfi's is even popular within the student community, is the Sunday brunch. This is one of Cornell's true gems, and attending is in fact is one of the 161 things every Cornellian should do (you have to charge it to Cornellcard for it to count though!). Every other possible experience you could have here pales in comparison to this.Brunch is held starting at 11 AM each Sunday. Depending on what's going on on campus, you might want reservations, or the place might have been booked 2 years ago (homecoming, graduation, etc). Most weekends it's no big deal. You walk in, they show you to your table, and they let you at it. Service isn't an issue this time, because all they are doing is clearing out the plates as fast as you can mow through them. Cost is $20 per person; for $9 you can add a bottomless champagne flute if it's after noon and you want to have some fun. The selection of foods is vast, and covers the gamut of basically all the breakfast and lunch foods you could expect. In the center is a wide selection of cold salads, usually including things such as a buffalo mozzerella and tomato salad, a salmon and caper salad (delicious), couscous salads, and a whole bunch of other constantly changing selections. To the right are the cold breakfast foods, including a full selection of pastries, bagels, flavored spreads, fresh fruits, yogurt, a good selection of imported cheeses, smoked salmon, and peel-and-eat shrimp. For the hot selections, there are usually about six breakfast choices, including belgian waffles, pancakes, excellent sausages, grits, eggs, and the usually. Additionally, there are usually about five lunch entree selections, which in the past have included four cheese ravioli with vodka sauce (very good), mahi mahi with red pepper sauce, bouillabaisse, carved lamb, and prime rib. Dessert is the best part, as I usually eat enough to make back the cost right there. There are usually about six selections, and if the concept of all-you-can-eat creme brulee doesn't strike your fancy, I don't know what will. Overall, the variety is very good, and the quality is excellent. This is what they are famous for and they go all out for it. So, in short, go for brunch, you won't be disappointed.", 4, 5, "MgVcMxtMetUfujhgquaXYA"], "65E5QmR5zlJwhzHJkoDudw": ["Yelp", "Taverna Banfi", "11/9/2007", "Don't go here for dinner.

They feature a sushi bar near the front of the restaurant and larger group seating in the \"second level\". The location is convenient for Ithaca's student population being right below Collegetown Plaza, across the street from Eddygate, and half a block down from Collegetown Center. It doesn't have much of an authentically Asian vibe to it.Food Review --Plum Tree has a great selection of rolls, sashimi, and warm udon dishes. I have previously tried the 007 roll and a couple others here for dinner, so this time I decided to try my luck with the lunch boxes (served between 11:30am and 2:30pm). At the low price of $9.95, I assumed that if it turned out badly, not too much harm could come of it.From a long list of lunch specials I ordered the chicken katsu, lightly breaded and fried chicken. It came with rice, a small salad, two fried dumplings, a handful of edamame beans, and four pieces of an avocado roll. It was already looking like a got a bang for my buck! The breading on the katsu was a little overcooked, resulting in slightly dry and overly crispy chicken.A friend of mine got the spicy tuna & salmon roll combo and she was kind enough to let me swipe a couple off her plate. I was pleasantly surprised by the ratio of rice to fish in each bite. Plum Tree doesn't skimp on the sushi filling. The spicy tuna also had a nice kick to it.Service Review --Our waiter was very quick with taking our order and then he vanished. Luckily, one of the guys I've seen working there is always cheerful enough and he gave us a big smile and cheerful \"hello\" and \"goodbye\" in Japanese (I'm assuming) as we left.Overall Impression --Competing with Miyake for the best sushi in town, I'd have to say that Plum Tree is my favorite of the two. Although a little pricey with some of their items, Plum Tree's lunch special will not make a dent in your wallet and still leave you feeling pretty full. Although Miyake does have a tasty signature dish, their Super Bowl, it goes for an outrageous $17.95 and with tax & tip you end up forking over a ridiculous $20+.

I probably eat here too often, but as an undergraduate with little time to cook, let alone eat, it is one of the best options for a quick bite.Insider's Scoop: The best items served at Apollo are not on the menu, so go with a friend who understands the ins-and-outs of Chinese cuisine.", 4, 2, "0gmCzmFz99KDIedYc3eAvw"], "by_rh3blC4HNjwuNs66VXw": ["Yelp", "Apollo Restaurant", "6/26/2013", "The rice is usually very colorless and seems old.

It quickly became a staple of my college diet and I'm proud/horrified to say I came here at least twice a week. $6.75 for instant Chinese food is too good to pass up. I've actually been known to come here right before a final, order some food, and walk to the final while eating. Filled my stomach but didn't do much for my grades. The main reason people come here is for the speed. They lay out about 12 already-cooked items that you can choose from along with rice. I tend to get 2 items and white rice to go. All of the food is actually somewhat authentic and pretty good. My favorite is the soy sauce chicken. Tender, saucy, and meaty. There's also free bowls of soup (usually egg drop but sometimes seaweed) which will warm you up on a cold Ithacan night. They also have a menu from which you can order items that they'll cook. They tend to be a little more expensive and take longer to procure but are also more delicious. The congee and eggs over rice are quite amazing. Four stars because it's dependable.

Will never come back, would not recommend. My friends and I stopped by for dinner as a party of 3 last weekend. It was packed that night but we we were seated after 15 minutes, a bit sooner than the expected wait time. Our waitress took a while to take our order--understandable, since the restaurant was packed. The wait to get our food, however, was significantly longer. My friends and I talked for as long as we could during this time, all while our waitress made the table of 8 behind us feel very accommodated, checking up on them and making small talk every so often. The table that was seated after us had already gotten their food after we waited for 30 minutes. After about 35-40 minutes of waiting, we saw that another table seated after us had gotten their food as well. I inquired about the status of our order, and after our waitress came back she informed us our order was fourth in line. Fourth in line?? I asked her why our order was so stalled but she kept saying there was a lot of people today....not a proper explanation since we shouldn't have even been on a line at that point when tables seated after us were already eating. Fourth in line also led me to believe she had just put in our order only after I asked about it.Yet still, we waited. Ten minutes later our waitress came back with just one of our dishes, and the wrong one, at that (tofu was used in place of chicken). We sent the dish back and after a total of over an hour of waiting, the crowd in the restaurant had completely died down.... Alas, only then did we get all of our food and a brief apology from our waitress. By that time, the table seated after us had already eaten finished their meal and was headed out. Our food was alright, though nothing to write home about. However, my friend who is vegetarian noted that she ate a small piece of chicken in her tofu Pad Thai. Thankfully she is vegetarian by choice and doesn't have any serious adverse reactions from consuming chicken so we didn't want to make it a serious ordeal by complaining to the staff.The biggest joke of the night however, was when waitress told us that the 18% gratuity is mandated by the establishment when she handed us our check, probably knowing the service overall was sh*t but still wanting to be compensated for it. I decided to complain to the manager, expecting him to be sympathetic. While he did eventually take the gratuity off our tab, he first gave me a small lecture on the purpose of gratuity. Not appreciating his condescension, I repeated that the gratuity paid should reflect the service received and then I brought up the fact that my vegetarian friend had a piece of chicken in her dish. He replied it was impossible given the way he runs his kitchen. Listen, I don't go to restaurants to nit-pick at service or lie about the food I receive, and I certainly don't go looking to argue with restaurant managers about the way they run their kitchens; I go to eat. While I don't believe the old adage \"the customer is always right\" is in fact always right, any respectable restaurant manager should respect their customer's word. My friends and I paid and left, thoroughly disappointed with Taste of Thai. If you're looking for a place to eat, go anywhere else and if all other establishments are packed, you might as well go to a supermarket like Wegman's for their already prepared foods because Taste of Thai's is certainly not worth the trouble.

Was I in a Seinfeld sketch? I waited for her to laugh or ask me what I'd ordered so they could rush it out to the table. Instead she said well that it was too late, the chef was tired because it was xmas eve and the soup had to be \"made to order\"--making it seem like I was being a burden to them by eating there. Keep in mind that they were fully open for business and had taken my reservation a couple days before. I looked around at the completely empty restaurant (it was only a little after 5pm) and said \"We are the only people here. I'd still like to have my soup if that's okay\". She looked offended, rolled her eyes and stalked back to the kitchen where I could plainly hear her tell the chef that \"this guy just yelled at me out there\". I was so shocked by her crazy attitude (even my relatively quiet elderly mother muttered that she \"was out of line\") and I was so pissed off that it completely dragged me out of my good mood for Xmas eve dinner with my mother.

Also, their Pad Kee Mao with pork is quite good. Greasy, but good. The Pad Thai is tasty in-and-of-itself, but not the best, by a long shot.

I replied \"allergies, but it is also my preference.\" The cashier had a conversation later with my friend when she asked her why such an odd question was being asked to anyone ordering vegan dishes.

There should be no difference between the preparation of a vegan waffle for allergy or ethical reasons and it felt invasive to be questioned that way.

However, what sets Waffle Frolic aside from many other Ithaca eateries (who are more so Vegan accommodating) is that Waffle Frolic labels everything that is Vegan or Vegetarian. On top of that, they have a vegan ice cream. I mean come on. My vegan friend's eye lit up when we walked in. Never mind the forever existing line for a Sunday morning. The shop has a simple and straightforward menu. You walk in and you follow the easy steps: pick a waffle (gf/vegan options available), pick a size (single or twin) and then pick your toppings. Indecisive? No prob. They have tons of pre-\"arranged\" waffle meals including chicken with waffle (next on my list to try), waffle with two eggs and bacon (yum), grilled cheese, turkey chili with a cornbread waffle, and they always have some specials.

It is definitely first come first serve and if you get there at the wrong time, you might just need to grab a seat outside on one of the benches in the Commons.

My savory waffle worked really nicely--I was concerned they wouldn't time the temperature of all the components right, but it was perfect. The eggs were cooked over easy and my bacon crispy but not burt. As a waffle iron owner, I was definitely impressed with the flavor packed meal.

Perhaps waiting an hour for my food would have been less torturous if the noise level was tolerable. The space seems to be constructed in the worst possible way for noise.Secondly, breakfast is so poorly organized and the service is so terrible that I've never seen the wait for a table be less than 30 minutes. We waited 30 minutes to be \"seated\" then another 30 to receive our food. The entire time we were in the dining area, there were 4-5 open tables, with 10 or more people still waiting to be seated. Why are so many people waiting so long when there are open tables?!There's always a long wait, but there is no good place to wait. No chairs. People were sitting on the floor. It's not clear if there is table service. They have a weird system where you have to wait to be given a table number, then order at the counter and sit at an assigned table.

It was a bit bland so it probably could have used a few more hours of sitting in marinade. Again, I didn't complain because the tiny human I am growing is demanding that I eat ASAP. The size of the pick de gallo and guacamole was a bit skimpy. Don't be fooled by my photo. It's all lettuce under that guacamole/pick de gallo serving. The rice that came with the dish was delicious and the corn tortilla they served with the dish was a bit soggy from sitting inside the foil wrapper so they ripped easily when I put the steak and fixings on them.Maybe it was an off night for them so I'll probably give them another shot in the future.

The steak had an off taste as if it was going bad.

He was uninterested in engaging us or even being polite. Also, he does not know the menu or understand Mexican food. When I ordered the Al Pastor Street Tacos, he asked me what kind of meat I wanted. In a surprised voice, I told him pork. Later I realized that he tried to charge me extra for \"upgrading\" to pork. Hah, look at your menu, the dish is made exclusively with pork. Finally and worst of all, he never came by our table to ask how we were enjoying the food and even disregarded me nodding (across the room) for him to come to the table. There are of course many problems with him not checking on us, but the real issue here was my wife's bad plate. We couldn't get someone to our table for probably 10-15 minutes.

Food:1) Fresh spring rolls - came torn with insides spilled out all over the container. Spring roll wrappers are a bit sticky so while picking them up they can rip, this is understandable. But they came ripped. So they were pre-made and in the process of packing them, got ripped. You wouldn't serve ripped spring rolls in the restaurant, you shouldn't serve them for delivery. The hoisin/hot sauce container was only 1/3 full. There was 1 shrimp per roll (3 rolls total), the shrimp had been split into two. The shrimp tasted gummy and muddy, it felt like potentially frozen shrimp. No flavor at all.2) Spicy Rad Nah - noodles and broth came separately which is good so the noodles don't get soggy. However, the noodles were swimming in grease and stale. They were hard . Additionally, the broth had very little chicken in it. Only 4 or 5 pieces. I understand to accommodate many different tastes, the meat is generally cooked separately then added to the broth, but this meant that the chicken and the noodles had none of the flavor of the broth. Everything played separately, no harmony to the dish.3) Fresh lime soda - this was the only good thing in the order.

I've arrived at the restaurant at least once or twice within the past few months and they've had an order wrong...or the person tending the register has given me someone else's takeout order. Thankfully, in the latter instance, I double-checked the order when I got to my car and noticed the mistake. The girl who had gotten my order just after had noticed quickly as well, so we both just got back into the restaurant and switched our bags upon noticing the error. Also, as another reviewer said about the curry options, there are also some nights where the curry isn't the best - it can be a bit off in consistency. With things like the curry, vegetable crispness or other matters of preparation though? I think a lot of that probably has to do with timing and how much activity is going on in the kitchen. If they're having to more rapidly prepare food because volume of diners is higher, then perhaps the curry is just fresher/more recently prepared. I don't know. There are certainly better Thai restaurants around town. If I'm going to sit down and enjoy a meal with friends from out of town, for example? I'll probably head over to Tamarind.

If that info is true, the other side of the family that runs Taste of Thai should really look at what his brother at Express is doing (and his prices, which are slightly better). His staff is much happier and treat their customers with courtesy... they do not have the chipped shoulders that Taste of Thai (on the Commons) employs. For whatever reason, Taste of Thai charges you a couple more dollars to be horribly abused by the staff (this is not even a little exaggerated).

As many residents of Ithaca would agree, we are blessed to have a few tasty restaurants in the form of Thai cuisine in Ithaca, and Taste of Thai would obviously go to the top of the list. However, the original flavor that we enjoyed at Taste of Thai began to subside recently-may be the sign of the times?-, I was surprised to find that Taste of Thai Express (hence the Express) offers better tasting food than the former. In the past year, I thought that Express was just a to-go place of Taste of Thai, I did not bother to eat there for some time. Recently, a classmate who can point out very good restaurants treated me with Thai food - chicken sticks, Tom Yan soup, Pad Thai and Shrimp rolls - from the Express, which won me over. Although I believe that the Thai restaurants in Ithaca area offer a rather high quality (even for an Asian like me) of food and services - I visited couple of Thai restaurants in San Francisco during my undergraduate days and can compare my experience from there - , I must say that the Express is the best out of them all. As they say in the website, the material of the food are of high quality (mostly organic food grown in Ithaca), and seem to use less MSG, an artificial ingredient that many Asian restaurants are fond of using. Most of all, as my former PR manager wife who fondly remembers the great food from Singapore during her business trips there, would agree that the taste and the quality of the food from the Express is very much like the ones that she had in Singapore. Although we would order from Express for home delivery, you can certainly visit the place for an on-site dining experience, which we have yet to do so.
