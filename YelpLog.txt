The ordering/seating area is slightly uncomfortable, specially on a cold day when the patio cannot be use. They do have patio warmers which were not been used. We ordered two Olympian wraps because their description sounded appetizing (Free Range Chicken breast, Feta cheese, fresh spinach, black olives, tomato & balsamic vinaigrette dressing, in a sun-dried tomato wrap). Once we got to tried out it tasted weird. Some sort of bitterly flavor. After a couple of bites into it realized that it tasted like coffee. My best guess is that they mistakenly put coffee instead of balsamic vinegar. We complained and got another wraps. However, the damage was already done. I still cannot erase the perturbed flavor of coffee-chicken.Chances are I won\'t ever stop in this place again.", 1, 0, \'uv7n9Af48hRVlpLNojvi7g\'], \'zRuAFkGmC8OtsYfZ1oO0jA\': [\'Yelp\', \'Collegetown Bagels\', \'9/30/2018\', "I have a love-hate relationship with Collegetown Bagels.

They are known to be CTB favorites, so I knew we couldn\'t go wrong with them-- and they delivered! The Vegetarian was topped with vegetable cream cheese, tomato, and muenster (my personal favorite!), and those three ingredients created the most delicious cheesy + creamy combination! My favorite, however, was the Cali Sunrise, which had smooth, creamy avocado, scrambled egg, red onions, and melted goat cheese. Those paired with the rosemary salt bagel were the perfect balance of aromatic and savory goodness.

My friend insisted that I try the raspberry jalape\xc3\xb1o jam, so we got some on the side.

You enter at one end of CTB, order at a counter, are asked either "for here" or "to go" and are given a slip of paper with your order on it, which you take down to the registers. Along the way, you are asked if you want any pastries or coffee/tea, which you can order from one of the workers, or pick up any of their many "grab and go" items, like prepackaged pastas, sandwiches, cream cheese, sodas, etc. You pay for everything at the register and they stamp your ticket, which is either handed back to you (if you\\\'re taking it to go) or placed on a numbered stand which you bring to your table. If you\\\'re anything like me, you\\\'ll develop your go-to order over time: for me, if I want something easy and fast, I\\\'ll get a rosemary salt bagel with plain cream cheese, which at under $3 makes a nice and easy breakfast on my way to class. If I want a full sandwich, I usually get the Sweet Rachel (turkey, honeycup mustard, muenster cheese, and onions on pumpernickel). The Sweet Rachel is my favorite out of the sandwiches I\\\'ve tried, but let\\\'s be honest, it\\\'s not THAT good. I don\\\'t think the quality of the ingredients is high enough to justify the cost (roughly $7.50 and that\\\'s one of the cheaper sandwiches) and it\\\'s not like there\\\'s a markup for cooking skill because, again, it\\\'s a freakin\\\' sandwich. Also, I like honeycup mustard a lot so I don\\\'t mind, but GOD they really slop it on there. Let\\\'s just say that if you need a quick fix for congestion, this sandwich will really clear your sinuses. I\\\'ve also tried the BBQ jack, which is good if you want something gluttonous and warm, and the Euro (ham, brie, honeycup, etc) which also has an obscene amount of mustard and isn\\\'t super good. Another favorite is the flat rock (turkey, goat cheese, balsamic, sun-dried tomatoes, basil) which is really good but so so small. I could practically eat three of them but at like $8.50 or something that would be unreasonable. The baked goods aren\\\'t good at all. Very stale and taste like they\\\'ve been sitting in that case for weeks. The coffee drinks are good, but outrageously priced. I understand they\\\'re nicer drinks or nicer coffee or whatever but go to Starbucks right across the street. I\\\'ll continue going to CTB, but mostly because of the location. The outside seating is also really nice but is only a real pull factor for about 2 weeks of the year (thanks Ithaca). TL;DR : Crappy Zingerman\\\'s (Ann Arbor, MI) wannabe. Really small, overpriced sandwiches. Stale baked goods, expensive coffee.

Once you receive your slip containing the code to your order, proceed through the beverage/cold food area. Shop accordingly.   3. Upon arriving at the hot beverage counter, look for a designated hipster, order a coffee (you can even order according to your horoscope if you choose) and hand over other goods plus any acquired slips. Feel free to order the "ultra" size so you can rub it in the face of the Venti lovers across the street. Pay accordingly and wait for your order. While waiting, take note the clientele; non-designated hipsters, Cornell students, tourists and proud parents of Cornell students wearing Cornell shirts, walking shorts and mid-calf socks. 4. Listen for your name (for good fun give them the name you really wanted as a child), receive your fare and enjoy. The Melissa (egg and cheese) on an everything bagel was a fine breakfast.

I think it might be because I dream of the soft fluffy bagels from my hometown and hope that maybe all the other bad experiences I had were flukes. First things first, CTB IS NOT A BAGEL PLACE. Their bagels are small, hard, dry, chewy and flavorless. I ordered a blueberry bagel with cream cheese, thinking I would get a sweet purple bagel the size of my head. After all, I paid $2.75 for that bagel. Instead, I got the biggest disappointment of my life. It\\\'s like they don\\\'t even try because they have such a cult following. If you actually want a good bagel, you\\\'ll have to go to NYC or NJ. I would say the worst bagel place in NJ is better than CTB. Honestly, their other food isn\\\'t too bad but it\\\'s very expensive. They have interesting drinks and sandwiches, and that is why I gave them 2 stars instead of 1. BUT they shouldn\\\'t call themselves a bagel place because their bagels are horrible. THE EXPERIENCE The place is always crowded and I can\\\'t understand why. You wait in a ridiculous line where there are infinite choices written in colored chalk all around the place. When the staff gets to you, they rush you for your order even though it\\\'s impossible to make a decision with so many colors. Instead you just stand there like a buffoon trying to read all of the descriptions. Then, once they finally take your order and you pay, you have to wait FOREVER to get your food. I ordered a bagel with cream cheese UNTOASTED and waited for 10 minutes. I wanted to just ask them to give me the bagel and a knife and I\\\'d make it myself it\\\'s ridiculous. Every other bagel place I\\\'ve been to, one staff member tends to your order, and your wait time is proportional to the intricacy of your order. At CTB, your order is placed in line behind all of the other complicated orders like an assembly line, and you have to wait for all of those orders to be done first. Honestly, I think they skip over the extremely uncomplicated orders like mine, because they\\\'re not used to people ordering bagels at their "bagel place." I\\\'ve noticed that drinks come pretty quickly though, and it seemed that people ordering other food got theirs before mine.THE BOTTOM LINE If you go to CTB expecting it to be a bagel place like in your hometown, you\\\'ll be disappointed. If you want a hip place where all of the item names are based off of pop culture references and are overpriced, where all the cool kids hang out, then CTB might be for you.

Even as a vegan, I felt spoiled for choice. I ended up having a decent meal, but unfortunately that was entirely overshadowed by the poor service.You see, I came here twice on the same day. First, I was there in the late morning, a little before the lunch rush. I ordered a panini while my partner ordered a bagel sandwich and a coffee. Her order came out in normal time, probably within 5-10 minutes. I started to worry that they had forgotten my order when she was pretty much done with her meal and I was still waiting longingly for food (about 20 minutes had passed).So I asked one of the cashiers to check whether my order had gone through. She seemed baffled that I would ask such a thing, and she gave me a side-eye as she walked to the deli area to check in. She came back and assured me that my panini was coming right up. 10 minutes later, and it still hadn\'t arrived. After waiting a total of 35 minutes, my sandwich finally came, and I promptly devoured it - it wasn\'t very large (more of a snack than a meal), and I was super pretty hungry at that point. It was a decent sandwich, but definitely not worth the wait.Stupidly, we came back again in the afternoon hoping to grab a quick drink before hitting the road for Boston. We tried to give CTB the benefit of the doubt, blaming the prior sandwich delay on the heavy lunch traffic. Unfortunately, the service problems run deeper than that. We learned this lesson the hard way, as our smoothie didn\'t come out for 20 minutes. This time, there were no excuses; it was early afternoon and there were basically no other customers around and the staff were chatting about weekend happenings throughout. We checked in about our order, and it turns out our order ticket was just left on the counter and was forgotten about. I have no idea why this happened twice (!) to us in two visits on the same day, but it\'s maddening, and really makes me question the management here. And to make matters worse, the smoothie was ultimately not very good, in spite of being quite overpriced ($6.20 I think).

The California Sunrise Bagel was alright, but the guacamole-like paste resembled a cheap store bought substitute and was not the "avocado" I was expecting. Service Review -- As a Collegetown favorite, CTB is used to a high volume of traffic especially in rushes as students try to grab a bite or a drink before class.

I ordered a bagel with cream cheese UNTOASTED and waited for 10 minutes. I wanted to just ask them to give me the bagel and a knife and I\\\'d make it myself it\\\'s ridiculous. Every other bagel place I\\\'ve been to, one staff member tends to your order, and your wait time is proportional to the intricacy of your order. At CTB, your order is placed in line behind all of the other complicated orders like an assembly line, and you have to wait for all of those orders to be done first. Honestly, I think they skip over the extremely uncomplicated orders like mine, because they\\\'re not used to people ordering bagels at their "bagel place." I\\\'ve noticed that drinks come pretty quickly though, and it seemed that people ordering other food got theirs before mine.THE BOTTOM LINE If you go to CTB expecting it to be a bagel place like in your hometown, you\\\'ll be disappointed. If you want a hip place where all of the item names are based off of pop culture references and are overpriced, where all the cool kids hang out, then CTB might be for you. I\\\'m going to stick with 7-eleven, because I can get twice as much food, twice as delicious, for half the price and in one eighth the time.\', 2, 3, \'uv7n9Af48hRVlpLNojvi7g\'], \'Y8xX-PtGUuqUp7TT_qUKIA\': [\'Yelp\', \'Collegetown Bagels\', \'8/30/2010\', \'Yum!I love this place!!

There\\\'s one sandwich with roast beef, honey mustard (with a real kick), and muenster cheese on pumpernickel which I thought was really really good. I love the California bagel as well (which has avocado, pepperjack cheese, and scrambled egg).It\\\'s super vegetarian (and vegan) friendly and they offer ready made salads and wraps and sandwiches as well if you don\\\'t have time to wait in line (because sometimes the line is super long).

I am obsessed with coffee and asked to go to the coffee shop where all of the students go- every college town has one, and in this case, it seems to be Collegetown Bagels. At first, I was surprised that we were getting coffee at a bagel shop, until we walked in. There are two separate lines, one for bagels and sandwiches and the other for drinks and coffee. I liked the cozy vibe of the shop, which had an eclectic inside and a seating area with a bunch of windows. There was an abundance of seating outside as well, where we sat even though it was a rainy day. I was impressed by extensive and creative menu of drinks, which all had super fun names after celebrities and random things. The options were dramatically written out on a chalk board. I was stuck between the Don Draper and the chai, but ultimately got the chai, which was delicious. If I lived in Ithaca, I would definitely study or get food or coffee at Collegetown Bagels frequently. The bakery options looked really good, too, but I was pretty full already.

For reference, the bread of the paninis here are usually smaller than my hand outstretched. It\'s also $8-12 for a panini which will also take them a ridiculously long time to make. As for the breakfast sandwiches, CTB skimps on the meat and uses what I can only describe as egg discs/egg pucks, and not real eggs.

Along the way, you are asked if you want any pastries or coffee/tea, which you can order from one of the workers, or pick up any of their many "grab and go" items, like prepackaged pastas, sandwiches, cream cheese, sodas, etc. You pay for everything at the register and they stamp your ticket, which is either handed back to you (if you\\\'re taking it to go) or placed on a numbered stand which you bring to your table.

Another favorite is the flat rock (turkey, goat cheese, balsamic, sun-dried tomatoes, basil) which is really good but so so small.

The cashiers were cheerfulVenue Review -- As mentioned earlier, the flow of traffic is great, which is a necessity because it is often packed with students. The layout is long and narrow, which makes it difficult to squeeze by other people in line if you\\\'re trying to get to the refrigerated items in the middle of the store. CTB is very cozy with both indoor and outdoor seating. It\\\'s a great spot to grab a quick bite or to sit on the barstools by the window and people watch.Overall Impression --Having just received a giftcard to CTB, I\\\'m looking forward to putting it to good use. There is an enormous menu with a variety of bagel sandwiches, vegan friendly items, new soups made daily, and even some smoothies. I\\\'m very interested in trying out as many unique items as possible.

Once you receive your slip containing the code to your order, proceed through the beverage/cold food area. Shop accordingly.   3. Upon arriving at the hot beverage counter, look for a designated hipster, order a coffee (you can even order according to your horoscope if you choose) and hand over other goods plus any acquired slips. Feel free to order the "ultra" size so you can rub it in the face of the Venti lovers across the street. Pay accordingly and wait for your order. While waiting, take note the clientele; non-designated hipsters, Cornell students, tourists and proud parents of Cornell students wearing Cornell shirts, walking shorts and mid-calf socks. 4.

I think it might be because I dream of the soft fluffy bagels from my hometown and hope that maybe all the other bad experiences I had were flukes. First things first, CTB IS NOT A BAGEL PLACE. Their bagels are small, hard, dry, chewy and flavorless. I ordered a blueberry bagel with cream cheese, thinking I would get a sweet purple bagel the size of my head. After all, I paid $2.75 for that bagel. Instead, I got the biggest disappointment of my life. It\\\'s like they don\\\'t even try because they have such a cult following. If you actually want a good bagel, you\\\'ll have to go to NYC or NJ. I would say the worst bagel place in NJ is better than CTB. Honestly, their other food isn\\\'t too bad but it\\\'s very expensive. They have interesting drinks and sandwiches, and that is why I gave them 2 stars instead of 1. BUT they shouldn\\\'t call themselves a bagel place because their bagels are horrible. THE EXPERIENCE The place is always crowded and I can\\\'t understand why. You wait in a ridiculous line where there are infinite choices written in colored chalk all around the place. When the staff gets to you, they rush you for your order even though it\\\'s impossible to make a decision with so many colors. Instead you just stand there like a buffoon trying to read all of the descriptions. Then, once they finally take your order and you pay, you have to wait FOREVER to get your food. I ordered a bagel with cream cheese UNTOASTED and waited for 10 minutes. I wanted to just ask them to give me the bagel and a knife and I\\\'d make it myself it\\\'s ridiculous. Every other bagel place I\\\'ve been to, one staff member tends to your order, and your wait time is proportional to the intricacy of your order. At CTB, your order is placed in line behind all of the other complicated orders like an assembly line, and you have to wait for all of those orders to be done first. Honestly, I think they skip over the extremely uncomplicated orders like mine, because they\\\'re not used to people ordering bagels at their "bagel place." I\\\'ve noticed that drinks come pretty quickly though, and it seemed that people ordering other food got theirs before mine.THE BOTTOM LINE If you go to CTB expecting it to be a bagel place like in your hometown, you\\\'ll be disappointed. If you want a hip place where all of the item names are based off of pop culture references and are overpriced, where all the cool kids hang out, then CTB might be for you.
