I called for a reservation and was \"buzzed\" into the restaurant quickly and our table was ready us without an issue. The service was out of this world! Hostess greeted with a pleasant smile and our server was very attentive to our needs. They sat us in the lounge area which was PERFECT! It was quiet and the atmosphere was superb. Initially, our server brought out a focaccia bread platter with this marvelous olive oil dip (get extra..you'll need it). I ordered the Wild Striped Bass and the fish was cooked perfectly. It was very light and it was the perfect size. I wish it was more seasoned although. The cabbage base was yummy but it overpowered the dish, surprisingly. Other than that, the dinner was perfect.
