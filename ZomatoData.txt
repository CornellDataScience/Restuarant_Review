Within less than 5 minutes of our food came out one of the wait staff approached our table and explained that they had given my husband the wrong steak and they were in the process of making him a new one. The steak they had given him was well done, rather than the medium rare he had ordered. It was a good thing that he decided to go ahead and munch on it while he waited, as it took a long time for the new steak to come out and it was so rare that he couldn't eat much of it. Meanwhile, I attempted to eat the fish I had ordered that was horribly dry and over cooked. The waiter was very understanding and gave us free dessert and removed the fish from our tab.

Now, each table has one couch and two chairs. Madeline\u2019s couches are incredibly comfortable and, given the choice, I would never sit in the chairs. This means, by virtue of choosing the couch, I feel I am inevitably screwing at least one of my dining partners. Yet, despite my best efforts to be hospitable, giving up the couch is never an option. It seems I am just not that generous. To circumvent this, the last time I was seated here with a (close) friend, I suggested we do the date thing and both sit on the love seat.
